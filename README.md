Major thanks to Rich Pauloo for the
[{textme}](https://github.com/richpauloo/textme) package, which this
package relies entirely upon.

## Installation

You can install the released version of tgme from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("tgme")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("atsyplenkov/tgme")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(telegram)
library(tgme)
## basic example code
tgme("This is your text")
```
