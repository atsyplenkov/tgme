Description: This package will be familiar to fans of beepr or textme.
    The main function of this package is telegme(), which sends
    you a text message from R to your telegram bot. By adding a telegme() to a long-running
    job, you can leave the computer while it's processing, and receive 
    a text message via the instant that your job finishes. This package
    uses telegram package to send text messages, and thus requires a Telegram account..
